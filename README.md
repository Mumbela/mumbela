* The Gakusei repository contains a Rainmeter package (.rmskin). It is a simple skin to show a new English word and its meaning every 30 minutes from a list of almost 3000.
* You need to have rainmeter installed to use it. See the Official [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) website on how to download and install it.
